You are acting as a senior staff software architect, delivery quality auditor, planning consistency reviewer, and repository governance analyst.

You are executing Step 3 of a multi-step project planning workflow.

Step 1 produced:
Planner-docs/Main-Planing.md

Step 2 produced:
Planner-docs/Sub-Planing-Index.md
Planner-docs/Faz-<number>-Plans/Faz<number>.<subnumber>-<slug>.md

Your job in Step 3:
Audit and analyze the Step 2 sub-planning output.

This is a quality-control, coverage, consistency, and readiness audit task.

Do not implement product features.
Do not refactor code.
Do not modify source code.
Do not install dependencies.
Do not run destructive commands.
Do not run networked mutation commands.
Do not commit changes.
Do not push branches.
Do not open pull requests.
Do not write secrets, credentials, tokens, private keys, local environment values, or sensitive machine-specific data into any file.

Allowed file changes:
You may only create or update this file:

Planner-docs/Sub-Planing-Audit.md

Do not modify:
- Planner-docs/Main-Planing.md
- Planner-docs/Sub-Planing-Index.md
- any Planner-docs/Faz-*-Plans/*.md file
- any source code
- any config
- any tests
- any scripts
- any docs outside Planner-docs/Sub-Planing-Audit.md

If you find problems, do not fix them directly.
Instead, report them clearly in Planner-docs/Sub-Planing-Audit.md with recommended remediation actions.

Primary sources of truth:

1. Planner-docs/Main-Planing.md
2. Planner-docs/Sub-Planing-Index.md
3. Planner-docs/Faz-*-Plans/*.md

Main-Planing.md is the master plan.
Sub-Planing-Index.md and all sub-plan files must be checked against it.

Language:
Write Planner-docs/Sub-Planing-Audit.md in English.

Repository inspection requirements:

Before writing the audit, inspect the repository safely.

Run only safe read-only commands such as:
- pwd
- git status --short --branch
- git branch --show-current
- git log --oneline -n 10
- find Planner-docs -maxdepth 4 -type f | sort
- cat Planner-docs/Main-Planing.md
- cat Planner-docs/Sub-Planing-Index.md
- find Planner-docs -path "*/Faz-*-Plans/*.md" -type f | sort
- grep/ripgrep commands for headings and phase markers

Useful discovery commands:
- rg "^#|^##|Faz|Phase|Maturity|Acceptance|Risk|Dependency|Validation|Test|Desired|Scope|Out of Scope|Current Repository Evidence|Planned Work Breakdown" Planner-docs
- rg "TODO|FIXME|TBD|unclear|missing|later|future|assumption|blocked|blocker|risk|secret|token|credential|production|live|local|readiness" Planner-docs
- rg "docs/|Planner-docs/|Main-Planing|Sub-Planing|Faz-" Planner-docs

If Planner-docs/Main-Planing.md is missing:
- Create Planner-docs/Sub-Planing-Audit.md.
- Mark the audit status as BLOCKED.
- Explain that Step 3 cannot audit coverage without Main-Planing.md.
- Stop.

If Planner-docs/Sub-Planing-Index.md is missing:
- Create Planner-docs/Sub-Planing-Audit.md.
- Mark the audit status as BLOCKED.
- Explain that Step 3 cannot audit Step 2 index coverage without Sub-Planing-Index.md.
- Still inspect any Faz-*-Plans folders if present.
- Stop after writing the blocker audit.

If no Planner-docs/Faz-*-Plans/*.md files exist:
- Create Planner-docs/Sub-Planing-Audit.md.
- Mark the audit status as BLOCKED.
- Explain that Step 2 appears incomplete or missing.
- Stop.

Audit objectives:

You must evaluate:

1. Phase coverage
- Every main phase in Main-Planing.md must have a matching Planner-docs/Faz-<number>-Plans/ folder.
- Every main phase must have at least one sub-plan file.
- No major phase should be silently missing.
- No generated phase folder should exist without a corresponding main phase unless clearly justified.

2. Phase order consistency
- Generated folders must preserve the phase order from Main-Planing.md.
- Sub-plan numbering must be sequential within each phase.
- Detect gaps such as Faz2.1, Faz2.3 with missing Faz2.2.
- Detect duplicates such as two Faz3.1 files.
- Detect inconsistent numbering such as Faz-2-Plans containing Faz3.1 files.

3. Naming convention compliance
Expected folder format:
Planner-docs/Faz-<number>-Plans/

Expected sub-plan filename format:
Faz<phase-number>.<subphase-number>-<ascii-kebab-slug>.md

Check:
- ASCII-only filename slugs.
- No spaces in filenames.
- No Turkish characters in filenames.
- No duplicate filenames.
- Folder number and file phase number match.
- Slugs are meaningful, not generic.

4. Index accuracy
Check Planner-docs/Sub-Planing-Index.md against actual files.

Verify:
- It references all phase folders.
- It references all generated sub-plan files.
- It does not reference missing files.
- It does not omit existing sub-plan files.
- Detected phase count matches Main-Planing.md.
- Recommended execution order is plausible.
- Coverage checklist is honest.

5. Required section structure in each sub-plan
Every sub-plan must contain exactly these required top-level sections, in this order:

# Faz X.Y — <Sub-Phase Title>

## 1. Context
## 2. Goal
## 3. Description
## 4. Scope
## 5. Out of Scope
## 6. Current Repository Evidence
## 7. Planned Work Breakdown
## 8. Acceptance Criteria
## 9. Validation and Test Approach
## 10. Dependencies and Sequencing
## 11. Risks and Mitigations
## 12. Desired End State
## 13. Transition Criteria to the Next Sub-Phase

Detect:
- missing sections;
- wrong order;
- duplicated sections;
- sections with empty or placeholder content;
- wrong phase number in title;
- mismatch between filename and H1 title.

6. Content quality
For each sub-plan, evaluate whether it is:
- grounded in Main-Planing.md;
- grounded in repository evidence where possible;
- specific enough for Step 4 implementation-task decomposition;
- not generic boilerplate;
- not over-fragmented;
- not too vague;
- not trying to implement code;
- not silently changing the master vision;
- clear about what is in scope and out of scope;
- clear about local readiness vs live readiness where relevant;
- clear about security and operational boundaries where relevant;
- clear about verification;
- clear about acceptance criteria;
- clear about dependencies and transition criteria.

7. Scope drift
Detect whether Step 2 introduced:
- new major phases not present in Main-Planing.md;
- missing major phases;
- renamed phases that change meaning;
- excessive documentation-only work;
- premature production/live activation;
- auto-merge or destructive operations without approval;
- tool-specific decisions that should remain adapter/runtime-level;
- source-of-truth confusion.

8. Readiness realism
Detect misleading readiness language.

Flag cases where:
- documentation or skeletons are described as production-ready;
- local smoke tests are treated as live readiness;
- config examples are treated as working credentials;
- issue tracker state is treated as execution truth;
- adapter/tool pilots are treated as core scheduler/control-plane;
- tests are mentioned without concrete validation commands or acceptance criteria.

9. Security and governance audit
Check sub-plans for:
- secret-safe language;
- no token/credential values;
- least privilege assumptions;
- approval gates for risky operations;
- command execution safety if relevant;
- path traversal or artifact integrity concerns if relevant;
- CI/review/merge/deploy boundaries;
- local vs cloud boundary;
- human approval boundaries.

10. Step 4 readiness
Evaluate whether the sub-plans are ready to be decomposed into implementation tasks.

Step 4 will likely create detailed implementation task files with:
- task IDs;
- files to modify;
- exact acceptance criteria;
- validation commands;
- execution order;
- dependencies;
- rollback notes;
- risk classification.

Your audit must say which phases/sub-plans are ready for Step 4 and which need repair first.

Audit output file:

Create or update:

Planner-docs/Sub-Planing-Audit.md

Use exactly this top-level structure:

# Sub-Planing Audit

## 1. Audit Summary

Include:
- overall audit status: PASS, PASS_WITH_WARNINGS, or BLOCKED
- short explanation
- whether Step 2 output is usable for Step 4
- most important finding
- most important remediation action

Status definitions:
- PASS: Coverage and structure are complete; only minor wording issues exist.
- PASS_WITH_WARNINGS: Step 2 output is mostly usable, but some issues should be fixed before Step 4.
- BLOCKED: Missing main plan, missing index, missing sub-plan files, severe coverage gaps, or severe structure problems prevent reliable Step 4 decomposition.

## 2. Inspected Sources

List:
- files inspected;
- folders inspected;
- important commands run;
- things not verified.

Do not include secrets.

## 3. Main Phase Coverage Analysis

Create a table comparing Main-Planing.md phases to generated folders and sub-plans.

Columns:
- Main phase number
- Main phase title
- Expected folder
- Folder exists?
- Sub-plan count
- Coverage status
- Notes

Mark status:
- OK
- WARNING
- MISSING
- EXTRA
- BLOCKED

## 4. Sub-Plan File Inventory

List all detected sub-plan files grouped by phase folder.

For each file include:
- filename;
- detected H1 title;
- phase number match status;
- section structure status;
- content quality status;
- notes.

## 5. Naming and Ordering Check

Report:
- folder naming issues;
- filename naming issues;
- numbering gaps;
- duplicate numbers;
- folder/file phase mismatches;
- non-ASCII slug issues;
- order inconsistencies.

If no issues, explicitly say no naming/order issues were found.

## 6. Index Consistency Check

Compare Sub-Planing-Index.md to actual files.

Report:
- missing references;
- broken references;
- unindexed files;
- phase count mismatch;
- inaccurate coverage claims;
- questionable execution order.

## 7. Required Section Structure Check

For each sampled or all sub-plans, report required section compliance.

Prefer checking all sub-plans if the number is manageable.
If there are many files, check all headings programmatically/readably and sample content quality manually.

Include:
- missing sections;
- duplicated sections;
- wrong order;
- empty sections;
- placeholder sections.

## 8. Content Quality and Actionability Analysis

Analyze:
- whether sub-plans are specific;
- whether they are actionable;
- whether they preserve the main plan;
- whether they are suitable for Step 4 task decomposition;
- whether acceptance criteria are verifiable;
- whether validation approach is realistic;
- whether dependencies are explicit.

Be direct. If the docs are generic, say so.

## 9. Scope Drift and Architectural Consistency Analysis

Report any drift from Main-Planing.md.

Include:
- added/removed/renamed phase meaning;
- wrong ownership of state;
- tool vs core boundary confusion;
- premature live/production activation;
- over-documentation;
- missing security hardening;
- missing operational controls.

Adapt this section to the project domain if it is not an agentic/software-factory project.

## 10. Readiness Realism

Evaluate whether the planning language correctly distinguishes:
- docs vs implementation;
- skeleton vs working runtime;
- local readiness vs live readiness;
- smoke tests vs production confidence;
- examples vs real configs;
- pilot adapters vs production core.

Flag overclaims.

## 11. Security and Governance Findings

Report security/governance concerns in the generated plans.

Include:
- secret safety;
- command execution safety;
- path/artifact integrity;
- least privilege;
- approval gates;
- review/CI/merge boundaries;
- cloud/local boundary;
- destructive or risky operations.

If the project domain differs, adapt but still check for security boundaries.

## 12. Step 4 Readiness Assessment

Create a table:

Columns:
- Phase / Sub-Plan
- Ready for Step 4?
- Reason
- Required fix before Step 4 starts

Use statuses:
- READY
- READY_WITH_WARNINGS
- NEEDS_REPAIR
- BLOCKED

## 13. Prioritized Fix List

List concrete fixes needed before Step 4.

Write each finding as a single-line header in this form:

- AUDIT-FIX-NN | PX | <short title>

The severity token (PX) comes immediately after the id. Follow each header with optional detail bullets covering:
- affected file(s)
- issue
- recommended fix
- why it matters

Severity guide:
- P0: blocks Step 4 or could cause dangerous planning/implementation.
- P1: serious issue that should be fixed before implementation.
- P2: quality issue that can be fixed soon.
- P3: minor wording or maintainability issue.

Do not modify affected files. Only report fixes.

## 14. Recommended Next Command / Prompt

Provide a concise recommendation for the next prompt.

If audit PASS:
- Recommend Step 4 implementation-task decomposition prompt.
- Name the first phase/sub-plan to decompose.

If PASS_WITH_WARNINGS:
- Recommend a Step 3.1 repair prompt targeting only the identified files.
- Include the highest-priority repair scope.

If BLOCKED:
- Recommend the minimal prompt needed to unblock Step 2/3.

Do not actually run the next prompt.

## 15. Audit Result

End with:
- final status;
- confidence level: high, medium, or low;
- whether only Planner-docs/Sub-Planing-Audit.md was modified;
- whether any unexpected modifications were detected;
- whether Step 4 can safely begin.

Validation after writing the audit:

After creating/updating Planner-docs/Sub-Planing-Audit.md:

1. Read the file back.

2. Run:
   find Planner-docs -maxdepth 4 -type f | sort

3. Run:
   git diff -- Planner-docs/Sub-Planing-Audit.md

4. Run:
   git status --short

5. Confirm whether only Planner-docs/Sub-Planing-Audit.md changed.

6. If any file outside Planner-docs/Sub-Planing-Audit.md changed, report it as unexpected and do not attempt to fix unless explicitly asked.

Goal-following behavior:

This is a long audit task. Continue until the audit is complete.

Do not stop after checking only one phase.

Use this stopping rule:

You may stop only when one of the following is true:

A. Success:
- Planner-docs/Sub-Planing-Audit.md exists;
- Main-Planing.md coverage was checked;
- Sub-Planing-Index.md consistency was checked;
- all detected phase folders were inspected;
- all detected sub-plan files were inventoried;
- required section structure was checked;
- naming/order issues were checked;
- Step 4 readiness was assessed;
- prioritized fixes were listed;
- git status was checked.

B. Blocked:
- Planner-docs/Main-Planing.md is missing;
- Planner-docs/Sub-Planing-Index.md is missing;
- no sub-plan files exist;
- repository access/read errors prevent audit.

If blocked:
- still create Planner-docs/Sub-Planing-Audit.md;
- mark status BLOCKED;
- explain the blocker;
- provide the minimal next action;
- stop.

Final response requirements:

After completion, provide a concise final summary in English.

Include:
- audit status;
- number of main phases detected;
- number of sub-plan files inspected;
- number of P0/P1/P2/P3 findings;
- whether Step 4 can begin;
- the most important fix, if any;
- the recommended next prompt direction;
- confirmation that only Planner-docs/Sub-Planing-Audit.md was modified, or list unexpected modifications.

Remember:
This is an audit and analysis step.
Do not fix the sub-plans.
Do not create new phase plans.
Do not change the master plan.
Only create or update Planner-docs/Sub-Planing-Audit.md.
