You are acting as a senior staff software architect, technical program planner, and repository analyst.

Your job is Step 1 of a multi-step project planning workflow.

IMPORTANT:
- This is a planning and repository analysis task.
- Do not implement product features.
- Do not refactor code.
- Do not modify source files.
- The only file you are allowed to create or update is:
  Planner-docs/Main-Planing.md
- If the Planner-docs directory does not exist, create it.
- Do not create additional planning files.
- Do not install dependencies.
- Do not run destructive commands.
- Do not run networked mutation commands.
- Do not commit changes.
- Do not push branches.
- Do not open pull requests.
- Do not write secrets, tokens, credentials, private keys, or local environment values into the plan.

Project context to use:

PROJECT_NAME:
<WRITE_PROJECT_NAME_HERE>

PROJECT_INTENT:
<WRITE_THE_PROJECT_PURPOSE_HERE. IF THIS IS AN EXISTING PROJECT, DESCRIBE WHAT IT IS TRYING TO BECOME. IF THIS IS A NEW PROJECT, DESCRIBE THE PRODUCT/SYSTEM WE WANT TO BUILD.>

TARGET_END_STATE:
<WRITE_THE_DESIRED_FINAL_STATE_HERE. DESCRIBE WHAT “DONE” SHOULD LOOK LIKE FROM A PRODUCT, ENGINEERING, OPERATIONS, SECURITY, AND USER-VALUE PERSPECTIVE.>

KNOWN_CONSTRAINTS:
<WRITE_CONSTRAINTS_HERE: team size, infrastructure, local machines, cloud dependencies, budget, security boundaries, timeline assumptions, preferred languages/frameworks, must-use tools, must-not-use tools, regulatory/compliance boundaries, etc.>

IMPORTANT_FEEDBACK_AND_ARCHITECTURAL_PRINCIPLES:
Use the following principles while planning:

1. Do not confuse documentation, skeletons, smoke tests, and local contracts with production readiness.
2. Separate local readiness from live readiness.
3. Separate visible work-management state from execution truth.
4. A project plan should drive real end-to-end behavior, not endless planning artifacts.
5. Prefer phased delivery with measurable acceptance criteria.
6. Prioritize security and operational safety before live automation.
7. For agentic/software-factory style systems:
   - keep task, lease, attempt, artifact, policy, review, and approval state in the project’s own control plane or equivalent source of execution truth;
   - do not treat GitHub/Linear/Jira/Plane issue status as the only source of runtime truth;
   - every worker task should produce artifacts, logs, verification evidence, and review output;
   - no risky change should be considered complete without tests, review, and a clear merge/deployment gate.
8. For any system that runs commands:
   - avoid shell-string execution patterns;
   - prefer structured command schemas;
   - plan for path traversal protection, secret protection, artifact integrity, and least privilege.
9. For AI/model/gateway systems:
   - define model aliases instead of hard-coding provider model names everywhere;
   - separate planner, implementer, verifier, reviewer, and operator roles where useful;
   - do not use the same model family for implementation and review when cross-review is important.
10. For production plans:
   - include observability, telemetry, cost/latency/quality signals, backup/restore, release gates, and rollback paths.
11. Use a maturity model for phases where helpful:
   - M0: idea/docs only
   - M1: contracts/schemas defined
   - M2: deterministic local smoke
   - M3: local simulated execution
   - M4: single live dependency verified
   - M5: single real end-to-end workflow
   - M6: multi-worker or multi-user live workflow
   - M7: production-gated, observable, recoverable system

Your task:

Analyze the current repository in detail and create or update Planner-docs/Main-Planing.md with a high-level master project plan.

This Step 1 plan must describe the project’s current state and the rough phase roadmap from the current state, or from Phase 0 if the project has not started, to the desired final state.

Do not break every phase into detailed subtasks yet. Step 2 will do detailed phase decomposition later.

Step 1 should focus on:
- project vision;
- current-state analysis;
- target end-state;
- architectural direction;
- rough phases;
- goal of each phase;
- explanation of each phase;
- desired outcome of each phase;
- readiness/maturity interpretation;
- major risks;
- recommended execution order.

Repository inspection requirements:

Before writing the plan, inspect the repository safely.

Run only read-only or safe local commands such as:
- pwd
- git status --short --branch
- git branch --show-current
- git log --oneline -n 10
- find . -maxdepth 3 -type f | sort | head -200
- ls
- ls Planner-docs
- ls configs
- ls scripts
- ls services
- ls packages
- ls tests
- cat README.md if present
- cat AGENTS.md if present
- inspect pyproject.toml, package.json, Makefile, docker-compose files, CI workflow files, docs indexes, architecture docs, runbooks, test files, and config examples if present

You may use ripgrep/grep to discover important project markers:
- rg "TODO|FIXME|Phase|phase|roadmap|architecture|runbook|readiness|activation|production|security|policy|worker|scheduler|gateway|adapter|test|smoke|CI|Linear|GitHub|Temporal|LangGraph|LiteLLM|Codex|OpenCode|Claude|Gemini|API|database|Postgres|queue|artifact|approval|review" .

If the repo is empty or almost empty:
- Do not fail.
- Treat it as a new project.
- Create Phase 0 as project foundation.
- Use PROJECT_INTENT, TARGET_END_STATE, KNOWN_CONSTRAINTS, and IMPORTANT_FEEDBACK_AND_ARCHITECTURAL_PRINCIPLES as the primary source of truth.
- Explicitly state that repository evidence is limited.

If the repo already has Planner-docs/plans:
- Read them.
- Reconcile them instead of blindly duplicating them.
- Preserve useful existing intent.
- Identify contradictions, gaps, stale assumptions, and over-planning.
- Do not delete existing plans.
- Planner-docs/Main-Planing.md should become the high-level master plan that points future detailed planning in the right direction.

Output file requirements:

Create or update:

Planner-docs/Main-Planing.md

The document must be written in English.

Use clear headings and a professional engineering-planning tone.

The file must include exactly these top-level sections, in this order:

# Main Planing

## 1. Executive Summary

Summarize the project in 5-10 concise paragraphs.

Explain:
- what the project is;
- what it is trying to become;
- why this project exists;
- current maturity;
- the main planning conclusion;
- the most important next milestone.

## 2. Project Vision

Describe the long-term vision.

Include:
- product/system vision;
- intended users/operators;
- business or engineering value;
- what the project should make possible when finished;
- what must never be compromised.

## 3. Current State Analysis

Analyze the repository as it exists now.

Include:
- observed repository structure;
- implemented or partially implemented areas;
- documentation state;
- test/smoke/CI state;
- configuration state;
- operational readiness;
- security posture;
- production readiness;
- missing critical components.

If evidence is unavailable, say so explicitly.

Be objective. Do not overstate readiness.

## 4. Target End State

Describe the desired final state.

Include:
- functional target;
- technical target;
- operational target;
- security target;
- testing/review/release target;
- observability/governance target.

Make this concrete enough that later phases can be derived from it.

## 5. Architectural Direction and Key Decisions

Describe the recommended architectural direction.

Include:
- core system boundaries;
- control plane vs adapter/runtime/tools distinction;
- source-of-truth decisions;
- data/state ownership;
- integration boundaries;
- security and policy boundaries;
- artifact/evidence boundaries;
- human approval boundaries where applicable.

For projects that are not agentic systems, adapt these concepts to the project’s domain:
- core domain;
- external integrations;
- persistence;
- background jobs;
- UI/API boundaries;
- security and operational controls.

## 6. Phased Master Roadmap

Create a rough phase roadmap from the current state to the target end-state.

Do not over-detail. Each phase should have:
- Phase name
- Goal
- Description
- Desired end state
- Approximate maturity level, using M0-M7 where useful
- Key acceptance signals

Use a table if helpful, but keep each phase readable.

The phases should be realistic and sequential.

For an existing partially built project:
- start from the current observed state;
- do not restart from scratch unless the repo is essentially empty;
- include a stabilization/hardening phase before live/production activation if needed.

For a new project:
- start with Phase 0: foundation, scope, architecture, repo, contracts, and baseline quality gates.

Prefer 6-12 major phases.
Do not create 30 tiny phases.

## 7. Critical Risks and Gaps

List the most important risks.

For each risk include:
- risk;
- why it matters;
- likely impact;
- mitigation direction.

Include security, architecture, delivery, operational, dependency, testing, and maintainability risks where applicable.

Be direct. Do not soften serious issues.

## 8. Prioritized Next Steps

List the next 5-10 concrete actions after this Step 1 plan.

These actions should prepare Step 2 detailed decomposition.

Each action should be high leverage.

Do not assign exact dates unless the repository already contains a timeline.

## 9. Preparation Notes for Step 2

Explain how Step 2 should proceed.

Step 2 will break each phase into detailed tasks, acceptance criteria, dependencies, files to modify, test commands, and delivery order.

Include:
- which phases should be decomposed first;
- which phases should not be expanded yet;
- what evidence Step 2 should collect;
- what decisions need human confirmation before detailed implementation.

## 10. Repository Inspection Notes

Include a concise evidence log.

List:
- important files inspected;
- important commands run;
- important existing docs found;
- important assumptions made;
- things not verified.

Do not include secrets or environment values.

Quality bar:

The generated plan must be:
- grounded in actual repository evidence;
- useful for a senior engineering team;
- realistic;
- explicit about uncertainty;
- not a generic startup/project template;
- not just a summary of files;
- not an implementation plan yet;
- detailed enough to guide Step 2;
- concise enough to be maintainable.

Important behavior:

If you find severe blockers, call them out clearly.

If the repo has many docs but little live functionality, say that plainly.

If tests exist but do not prove live readiness, distinguish that.

If CI/local smoke exists, describe what it proves and what it does not prove.

If the project is already advanced in some areas, preserve that progress and plan from there.

If there are naming inconsistencies such as “Planing” vs “Planning”, do not rename files unless instructed. Use the exact required filename Planner-docs/Main-Planing.md.

Validation after writing:

After creating/updating Planner-docs/Main-Planing.md:
1. Read the file back.
2. Check that all required top-level sections exist.
3. Check that the document is in English.
4. Check that it does not contain secrets.
5. Run git diff -- Planner-docs/Main-Planing.md and review the diff.
6. Provide a final concise summary of:
   - what file was changed;
   - what current-state conclusion was reached;
   - how many high-level phases were proposed;
   - what the most important next action is;
   - any uncertainties or blockers.

Remember:
Only create or modify Planner-docs/Main-Planing.md.
Do not modify anything else.
