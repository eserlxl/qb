# Step 4 Implementation Handoff Prompt Template

This reference is not an auto-executed QB planning step.

Use it only after Step 3 writes `.qb/sub-planning-audit.md` and the audit says Step 4 can begin. Print the copy block below for the user to paste into a new Antigravity task or conversation.

If the audit status is `BLOCKED`, do not print this prompt. Print the minimal unblock prompt from the audit instead.

If the audit status is `PASS_WITH_WARNINGS` and any P0/P1 finding exists, do not print this prompt. Print a repair prompt targeting those P0/P1 findings first.

If the audit status is `PASS_WITH_WARNINGS` with only P2/P3 findings, this prompt may be printed, but state that the implementation run must keep those warnings visible.

## Copy Block

```text
Treat .qb/main-planning.md, .qb/sub-planning-index.md, .qb/sub-planning-audit.md, .qb/phase-*-plans/*.md, and any .qb/assessment.md, .qb/project-ontology.md, or .qb/planning-ledger.md as source material. Build an ordered implementation queue from the audit's READY and READY_WITH_WARNINGS rows, preserving the index order. If the audit contains P0/P1 findings, stop before implementation and propose a repair prompt.

If installed/available in Antigravity, use relevant skills, project rules, test guidance, and security review guidance by scope. If no supporting skill or helper agent is available, do not stop; continue using the audit, the active sub-plan, repo instructions, and existing validation commands with the same principles. Use GitHub publish/PR workflows only when explicitly requested. Use helper agents when they reduce context pollution or separate evidence gathering from implementation/review; do not use them for trivial single-file changes.

Execute the queue continuously in this Antigravity task run. For non-trivial slices, use this helper agent pattern when available: explorer maps relevant files and risks; tester/verifier identifies validation path; implementer/worker makes the smallest change; reviewer/security reviews the diff and evidence. Only one writer should modify files per slice unless the user explicitly requests parallel branches.

For each implementation slice:
1. Name the active phase/sub-plan and the specific acceptance criterion being targeted.
2. Read AGENTS.md, README.md, Makefile, repo instructions, the audit, the index, optional ontology/ledger files as needed, and only the active sub-plan plus required repo files.
3. Run git status and stop if unrelated dirty changes or conflicts exist.
4. Inspect relevant files before editing.
5. Prefer adding or adjusting a focused failing test first when practical.
6. Implement the smallest change that can satisfy the selected acceptance criterion.
7. Run targeted validation first.
8. Run the repo-level gate when targeted validation passes.
9. Append or update `.qb/planning-ledger.md` with a concise implementation summary for the verified slice or stop event. If the ledger does not exist, create it using the structure from QB planning-ledger guidance.
10. Summarize:
   - files changed;
   - acceptance criterion addressed;
   - tests/commands run;
   - evidence produced;
   - remaining risks;
   - ledger entry added or updated.
11. Continue to the next acceptance criterion or the next READY/READY_WITH_WARNINGS sub-plan instead of stopping.

Stop only when one of these stop gates is hit: P0/P1 or safety/security finding; failing test or unresolved regression; missing required source file; unclear contradiction between plan, audit, and repo reality; credential/live-environment/human-approval requirement; destructive external mutation requirement; unrelated dirty worktree or merge conflict; validation command unavailable with no equivalent fallback; scope would exceed the selected sub-plan; token/context budget too low to continue safely; or the user explicitly asks to stop. When stopping, write a concise handoff summary with completed slices, changed files, verification commands, blocker text, and the next queue item.

Do not write secrets, tokens, private keys, or local credentials. Do not paste full logs into the ledger; store concise evidence paths or summaries. Watch token use: do not load every sub-plan into context; use the index/audit to navigate, read only the active sub-plan, and refresh queue status from the audit/index between slices. If context compaction or budget pressure is likely, summarize progress and continue only when the next slice can still be executed safely.
```

## Operator Notes

- Keep each implementation slice small and reversible, but continue through the ordered queue after each verified slice.
- Do not load every sub-plan into context unless the active slice requires cross-plan repair.
- Prefer existing repo validation commands over invented commands.
- Report exact blocker strings and separate code-delivery status from external config or credential blockers.
- Keep `planning-ledger.md` concise; it is a replanning memory artifact, not a transcript dump.
- Use `project-ontology.md` to preserve vocabulary, entity, workflow, boundary, integration, and invariant consistency for the active slice.
- Do not commit, push, open a PR, deploy, or mutate external systems unless the user explicitly asks in the Step 4 run.
