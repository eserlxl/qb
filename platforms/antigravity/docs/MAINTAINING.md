# Maintaining QB

This document covers validation and release maintenance for QB.

## Dependency-Free Repo Check

Run the default repository validation before every release:

```bash
make check
```

This checks required package files, Antigravity skill frontmatter (name and description), that the skill name matches its directory, cross-host residue in hand-authored files, package secret hygiene, and installer dry-runs. It intentionally uses only shell and Python standard-library commands.

On a normal local development machine, `make check` is expected to complete well under 30 seconds. Validator CLI smoke tests have a 30-second timeout, and any timeout or hang is a release blocker. The monorepo-root CI pins Python 3.12 with `actions/setup-python`.

If a real key is exposed in chat, logs, docs, examples, or commits, treat it as compromised and rotate it outside the repository before release. Validation output must identify only the file, line, and pattern name; it must not print the matched secret value.

## Validate Planner Docs

The skill ships a read-only validator for generated `.qb/` outputs. From a QB repository checkout, run:

```bash
python3 skills/qb/scripts/validate_planner_docs.py --root /path/to/project --mode step1
python3 skills/qb/scripts/validate_planner_docs.py --root /path/to/project --mode assessment --strict
python3 skills/qb/scripts/validate_planner_docs.py --root /path/to/project --mode step2 --strict
python3 skills/qb/scripts/validate_planner_docs.py --root /path/to/project --mode step3 --strict
python3 skills/qb/scripts/validate_planner_docs.py --root /path/to/project --mode step4
```

When changing the validator, test at least:

- a valid Step 2 fixture;
- a missing-section fixture;
- a normal filename containing `sk-` such as `task-spec.yaml`;
- a fake long secret token that should be detected;
- an OpenRouter key or an `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` entry set to a real value that should be detected while placeholder values remain allowed;
- roadmap table extraction with historical phase references such as `Phase 0B-10` or `Phase 11`;
- `--mode assessment` requiring `assessment.md`;
- optional `assessment.md`, `project-ontology.md`, and `planning-ledger.md` validation when present, and no failure when optional continuity docs are absent;
- Step 4 readiness gating for missing audit, `BLOCKED`, `PASS`, `PASS_WITH_WARNINGS`, and prose such as `no P0/P1 findings`.

The cross-platform invariant tests for every platform (including this one) live at
the QB monorepo root; run them from there:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Release Flow

1. Update `skills/qb/SKILL.md` and references as needed.
2. Update `skills/qb/references/repo-aware-intake.md` if Step 1 intake behavior changes.
3. Update `skills/qb/references/Assessment-Planner.md` if Step 1.5 assessment behavior changes.
4. Update `skills/qb/references/Fourth-Planner.md` if implementation handoff behavior changes.
5. Update `skills/qb/references/vibecoding-principles.md`, `task-delegation-playbook.md`, `planning-ledger.md`, `project-ontology.md`, `assessment-and-budget.md`, or `engineering-principles.md` when planning behavior changes.
6. Update `skills/qb/scripts/validate_planner_docs.py` if planner structure, continuity docs, or readiness gates change.
7. Run `make check`.
8. Install into a disposable project with `scripts/install.sh --scope ide-project --target "$(mktemp -d)" --dry-run`.
9. Preview the Antigravity app cache install with `scripts/install.sh --scope app-global --dry-run`.
10. Manually install to the desired Antigravity scope when ready.
11. Start a new Antigravity conversation or task before testing.

## Task Handoff and Replanning Memory Checks

When changing replanning behavior, verify that `planning-ledger.md` and `project-ontology.md` are read as supporting evidence and never treated as stronger than current repository state or explicit user intent.

When changing Step 4 behavior, verify that the prompt:

- continues through the READY/READY_WITH_WARNINGS queue after verified slices;
- appends concise ledger summaries when file writes are allowed;
- keeps P0/P1 gates blocking;
- states whether helper agents/tasks are useful or unnecessary;
- keeps exact blocker reporting and token/context stop gates.

## Sanitized Export

Do not create release zips with Finder or generic directory compression, because ignored files such as `.git/`, `__pycache__/`, `.env`, `artifacts/`, `logs/`, or `tmp/` can be included.

Use the tracked-file export target when this folder is inside a Git checkout:

```bash
make export-sanitized
```

This writes `QB-sanitized.zip` with `git archive`. The default `make check` gate validates archive contents when Git metadata is available. In an extracted or copied package without `.git`, `make check` falls back to filesystem package hygiene and package secret hygiene; that fallback does not claim tracked-file or archive guarantees.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Keep the skill concise.
- Keep long planner prompts in `references/`.
- Preserve the fixed `.qb/` planning filenames (`main-planning.md`, `sub-planning-index.md`, `sub-planning-audit.md`, `planning-ledger.md`) required by the bundled prompts.
- Do not add MCP servers, hooks, or generated assets unless validation is updated accordingly.
- Do not put secrets or environment-specific credentials into docs, planner prompts, or examples.
