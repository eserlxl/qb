**Repo-aware planning for Codex.** CodexQB turns a project repository into a durable planning package: main plan, existing-project autopsy, phase sub-plans, QA audit, and a gated implementation handoff.

![CodexQB workflow and release validation](docs/assets/codexqb-workflow.png)

CodexQB is a Codex plugin that installs the `$codexqb` skill. It is built for software, AI, infrastructure, security, and automation projects where planning needs to be evidence-backed, reviewable, and ready for step-by-step execution.

This package is the Codex platform build of QB. The planner prompts, reference docs, and the read-only `validate_planner_docs.py` are host-neutral shared sources maintained once in the QB monorepo and materialized into this plugin by the repository sync step. The plugin manifest, `SKILL.md`, `agents/openai.yaml`, docs, and `scripts/validate.sh` are the Codex-specific host files. CodexQB is an attributed port of the original CursorQB/CodexQB planning workflow by Alican Kiraz (MIT).

## Why CodexQB

- **Repo-aware intake:** CodexQB inspects the current repository before asking questions, then proposes evidence-backed defaults for project name, intent, target end state, and constraints.
- **Durable planning docs:** Output is written under `Planner-docs/` so long planning work survives context changes and can be reviewed like normal project documentation.
- **Project Autopsy:** Existing projects get a focused `Autopsy.md` report covering modules, features, placeholders, technical debt, integration gaps, validation gaps, and readiness risks.
- **Full phase decomposition:** The main plan can be expanded into ordered phase folders and detailed sub-plan files, using Autopsy feedback when available.
- **QA before implementation:** The audit step checks coverage, naming, ordering, section structure, readiness, security/governance, and implementation preparedness.
- **Gated execution handoff:** CodexQB does not implement product changes itself. It prints a separate Goal mode prompt only when the audit says implementation can begin, then guides that run through the READY queue in small verified slices.

## Workflow

| Step | What CodexQB Does | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Repo Scan + Main Plan | Reads the repository, asks four enriched intake questions, and creates the master plan. | `Planner-docs/Main-Planning.md` |
| 1.5 Autopsy | For existing projects, audits current project structure, features, placeholders, technical debt, integrations, validation, security, and readiness. | `Planner-docs/Autopsy.md` |
| 2. Phase Sub-Plans | Expands every main phase into detailed implementation-ready sub-plans. | `Planner-docs/Sub-Planning-Index.md`, `Planner-docs/Phase-*-Plans/*.md` |
| 3. QA Audit | Audits coverage, structure, quality, readiness, and governance without repairing files. | `Planner-docs/Sub-Planning-Audit.md` |
| 4. Gated Handoff | Prints a copy-ready implementation Goal prompt when Step 3 passes. | Text-only Goal mode prompt |

Step 1 runs in the current Codex thread. Steps 2, 3, and 4 are intentionally handed off as text-only Goal mode prompts so the user stays in control of long-running work.

## Quick Start

Add this repository as a Codex plugin marketplace:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add alicankiraz1/CodexQB --ref main
codex plugin add codexqb@codexqb
```

If the repository is private, your Codex/GitHub environment must have access to `alicankiraz1/CodexQB`.

Start a new Codex thread in the project you want to plan, then ask:

```text
Use $codexqb to inspect this repo and plan this project.
```

CodexQB will inspect the repository briefly, then ask for:

- `PROJECT_NAME`
- `PROJECT_INTENT`
- `TARGET_END_STATE`
- `KNOWN_CONSTRAINTS`

CodexQB asks intake questions in the user's language when practical. Generated Planner-docs artifacts are English by default unless the user explicitly requests another body language. Required document headings remain English for validator stability.

For existing repositories, the questions include repo-derived suggestions. For empty or minimal repositories, CodexQB falls back to concise generic questions and marks repository evidence as limited.

## Generated Artifacts

CodexQB writes planning artifacts under the target project's `Planner-docs/` directory:

```text
Planner-docs/
  Main-Planning.md
  Autopsy.md
  Sub-Planning-Index.md
  Sub-Planning-Audit.md
  Phase-0-Plans/
    Phase0.1-*.md
  Phase-1-Plans/
    Phase1.1-*.md
```

The artifact filenames (`Main-Planning.md`, `Sub-Planning-Index.md`, `Sub-Planning-Audit.md`, `Phase-<n>-Plans/`, `Phase<n>.<m>-*.md`) are fixed identifiers the bundled planner prompts and validator match exactly — don't rename them. (Renamed from the Turkish `Faz` and the misspelled `Planing` in 0.2.0; see CHANGELOG.)

## Validator

The skill includes a read-only validator:

```bash
python3 plugins/codexqb/skills/codexqb/scripts/validate_planner_docs.py --root /path/to/project --mode step2 --strict
python3 plugins/codexqb/skills/codexqb/scripts/validate_planner_docs.py --root /path/to/project --mode step3 --strict
python3 plugins/codexqb/skills/codexqb/scripts/validate_planner_docs.py --root /path/to/project --mode step4
```

These commands are for manual validation from a CodexQB repository checkout. When running through an installed plugin, CodexQB should use the bundled validator path exposed by the active skill; if that path is unavailable, it should perform equivalent all-file validation and report the fallback clearly.

The validator checks required sections, phase folders, filename conventions, index references, duplicate numbering, unindexed files, length-bounded secret patterns, and Step 4 readiness. P0/P1 audit findings block the implementation handoff.

Maintainers can run the dependency-free package check with:

```bash
make check
```

`make check` validates plugin JSON, required package files, `agents/openai.yaml` semantic fields, stale invocation names, and cross-host residue without requiring PyYAML or local Codex validator dependencies.

## Release Validation

Run this before sharing, committing, or pushing release changes:

```bash
make check
```

The repository also includes GitHub Actions at `.github/workflows/validate.yml`, which runs the same check on pushes to `main` and pull requests.

For sanitized zip sharing, use the tracked-file archive target instead of Finder or generic directory compression:

```bash
make export-sanitized
```

This creates `CodexQB-sanitized.zip` from `git archive`, excluding `.git/`, ignored Python caches, local env files, runtime folders, and other untracked local clutter.

## Safety Model

CodexQB is planning-first. Steps 1-3 should not:

- implement product features;
- refactor source code;
- install dependencies;
- run destructive commands;
- commit, push, deploy, or open pull requests;
- write secrets, tokens, credentials, private keys, or local sensitive environment values into planning files.

Generated plans should distinguish documentation readiness, local readiness, live readiness, production readiness, and operational evidence.

## Public Plugin Directory Status

CodexQB currently uses repository marketplace distribution. Public directory or workspace sharing distribution can be revisited separately; this release focuses on repo-marketplace installation and local/team validation.
