# Maintaining QB

This document covers validation and release maintenance for QB.

## Dependency-Free Repo Check

Run the default repository validation before every release:

```bash
make check
```

This checks JSON manifests, required package files, `agents/openai.yaml` semantic fields, stale invocation names, cross-host residue, and tracked-file secret hygiene. It intentionally uses only shell and Python standard-library commands so CI does not depend on local Codex validator dependencies.

On a normal local development machine, `make check` is expected to complete well under 30 seconds. Any timeout or hang is a release blocker. CI pins Python 3.12 with `actions/setup-python`.

If a real key is exposed in chat, logs, docs, examples, or commits, treat it as compromised and rotate it outside the repository before release. Validation output must identify only the file, line, and pattern name; it must not print the matched secret value.

## Optional Codex Validator Checks

The Codex skill/plugin validator scripts may require PyYAML in the active Python environment. Use them when available, but do not make them the only release gate.

```bash
CODEX_SKILL_VALIDATOR="${CODEX_SKILL_VALIDATOR:-$HOME/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py}"
CODEX_PLUGIN_VALIDATOR="${CODEX_PLUGIN_VALIDATOR:-$HOME/.codex/skills/.system/plugin-creator/scripts/validate_plugin.py}"

python3 "$CODEX_SKILL_VALIDATOR" plugins/qb/skills/qb
python3 "$CODEX_PLUGIN_VALIDATOR" plugins/qb
```

To validate an optional local global skill copy:

```bash
CODEXQB_GLOBAL_SKILL="${CODEXQB_GLOBAL_SKILL:-$HOME/.codex/skills/qb}"
python3 "$CODEX_SKILL_VALIDATOR" "$CODEXQB_GLOBAL_SKILL"
```

## Validate Planner Docs

The skill ships a read-only validator for generated `Planner-docs/` outputs. From a QB repository checkout, run:

```bash
python3 plugins/qb/skills/qb/scripts/validate_planner_docs.py --root /path/to/project --mode step1
python3 plugins/qb/skills/qb/scripts/validate_planner_docs.py --root /path/to/project --mode step2 --strict
python3 plugins/qb/skills/qb/scripts/validate_planner_docs.py --root /path/to/project --mode step3 --strict
python3 plugins/qb/skills/qb/scripts/validate_planner_docs.py --root /path/to/project --mode step4
```

When running through an installed plugin, use the bundled validator path exposed by the active skill. If that path is unavailable, perform equivalent all-file validation and report the fallback clearly.

`scripts/validate_planner_docs.py` is a shared, host-neutral validator. It is maintained in the monorepo's `shared/scripts/` source and materialized into this plugin by the repository `sync.sh`; edit the shared source rather than the synced copy.

When changing the validator, test at least:

- a valid Step 2 fixture;
- a missing-section fixture;
- a normal filename containing `sk-` such as `task-spec.yaml`;
- a fake long secret token that should be detected;
- roadmap table extraction with historical phase references such as `Phase 0B-10` or `Phase 11`;
- optional `Autopsy.md` validation when present, and no failure when it is absent;
- Step 4 readiness gating for missing audit, `BLOCKED`, `PASS`, `PASS_WITH_WARNINGS`, and prose such as `no P0/P1 findings`.

## Validate Skill Prompt Content

When changing Step 1 behavior, verify that:

- `SKILL.md` references `references/repo-aware-intake.md`;
- the intake reference still asks only the four stable fields;
- `SKILL.md` references `references/Autopsy-Planner.md` for Step 1.5;
- `Second-Planner.md` reads `Planner-docs/Autopsy.md` as an optional supporting source;
- `First-Planner.md` still accepts the same four required placeholders.

The planner prompts and reference docs (`First-Planner.md`, `Second-Planner.md`, `Third-Planner.md`, `Fourth-Planner.md`, `Autopsy-Planner.md`, `repo-aware-intake.md`, `workflow-quality.md`) are shared, host-neutral sources. They are maintained in the monorepo's `shared/` tree and materialized into this plugin by `sync.sh`; edit the shared source, not the synced copy.

## Optional Local Skill Copy Parity

If you maintain a local global skill copy, compare it with the repo-bundled skill after syncing:

```bash
CODEXQB_GLOBAL_SKILL="${CODEXQB_GLOBAL_SKILL:-$HOME/.codex/skills/qb}"
diff -ru plugins/qb/skills/qb "$CODEXQB_GLOBAL_SKILL"
```

This is a local-only workflow check. It is not required for CI or repository marketplace releases.

## Check For Stale Invocation Names

QB should use `$qb` as the skill invocation name. The default release check includes this scan:

```bash
make check
```

No public-facing stale references should remain.

## Sanitized Export

Do not create release zips with Finder or generic directory compression, because ignored files such as `.git/`, `__pycache__/`, `.env`, `artifacts/`, `logs/`, or `tmp/` can be included.

Use the tracked-file export target:

```bash
make export-sanitized
```

This writes `QB-sanitized.zip` with `git archive`.

## Release Flow

1. Update `plugins/qb/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`.
2. Update `plugins/qb/skills/qb/SKILL.md` and references as needed.
3. Update the shared `repo-aware-intake.md` source if Step 1 intake behavior changes, then re-sync.
4. Update the shared `Autopsy-Planner.md` source if Step 1.5 autopsy behavior changes, then re-sync.
5. Update the shared `Fourth-Planner.md` source if implementation handoff behavior changes, then re-sync.
6. Update the shared `validate_planner_docs.py` source if planner structure or readiness gates change, then re-sync.
7. Run `make check`.
8. Optionally run the Codex skill/plugin validator scripts if their Python dependencies are available.
9. Optionally sync and compare the local global skill copy for manual testing.
10. Commit with a focused message.
11. Push to `main`.
12. Reinstall the plugin in Codex:

   ```bash
   codex plugin add qb@eserlxl
   ```

13. Start a new Codex thread before testing.

## Public Directory Status

QB currently uses repository marketplace distribution. Public directory or workspace sharing distribution can be revisited separately; this release focuses on repo-marketplace installation and local/team validation.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Keep the skill concise.
- Keep long planner prompts in `references/`.
- Preserve the `Planner-docs/*Planning*` filenames required by the bundled prompts.
- Do not add MCP servers, apps, hooks, or assets unless the plugin manifest and validator are updated accordingly.
- Do not put secrets or environment-specific credentials into docs, planner prompts, or examples.
